README file for individual sparrow data for 
Pepke et al. (2022) Causes and consequences of variation in early-life telomere length in a bird metapopulation, Ecology and Evolution.

Below is a short explanation of variables in each coloumn. For details see the Methods section in the main text.
NA indicates missing data.

ID : individual identity number
year :	year
TL : relative telomere length
sex : male = 1 and female = 2
island_ID : identity number for natal island
tarsus : tarsometatarsus (tarsus) length measured in mm
survival : indicates whether an individual (ID) survived this year (1) or not (0)
age : age of individual (ID) in this year
first_year : year of hatching
last_year : year of last recording 
brood_ID : brood identity number
min_lifespan_years : minimum observed lifespan in years
recruits: number of recruits (offspring surviving their firt year) produced by the individual (ID) in this year
tarsus_agecorrected : age-standardized tarsus length (i.e. residuals of a tarsus vs. age model, see Methods)
